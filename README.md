Simple HTML games created with ChatGPT.

**Disclaimer:**

~99.9% of the code has been written and improved by ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com/

Some games contain graphics (mostly background images). Those have been generated with the help of MidJourney.

No cookies, tracking or server-sided data saving is done in this project. All tools are client-sided, limited to JS, CSS and HTML and therefore somewhat safe to use.
