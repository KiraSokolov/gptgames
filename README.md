# gptgames
Simple HTML games and tools created with ChatGPT.

---

**Disclaimer:**

~99.3% of the code has been written and improved by ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com/
(0.7% were debugging and minor styling tweaks done by me)

Some games contain graphics (mostly background images). Those have been generated with the help of MidJourney.

No cookies, tracking or server-sided data saving is done in this project. All tools are client-sided, limited to JS, CSS and HTML and therefore somewhat safe to use. 

The only exceptions are the Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe where the game data is stored in firebase and deleted after each game and Flappy Bird where you can optionally enter a nickname to store your high score in a firestore database.
