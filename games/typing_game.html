They said hello and asked how she was doing. She told them she was fine and asked about them. They said they were good too. Jane continued walking until she reached the park. She sat on a bench and watched the children playing. They were laughing and having a good time. She felt happy seeing them. A dog ran by and chased after a ball. Its owner was laughing and trying to catch it. Jane watched for a while before she got up and continued her walk. She saw a man reading a book and sat next to him. They talked about the book and what they liked to read. Jane enjoyed their conversation and felt grateful for the sunny day and good company.";
